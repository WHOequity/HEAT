### DESCRIPTION
<hr>

#### SOFTWARE
The WHO **Health Equity Assessment Toolkit** is a software application that 
facilitates the assessment of health inequalities. Inequalities can be assessed
through disaggregated data and summary measures of health inequality, visualized
in interactive graphs, maps and tables. Results can be exported and saved in
different formats. 

The toolkit is available in two editions: 
- **HEAT**, Built-in Database Edition, which contains the WHO Health Inequality
Data Repository;
- **HEAT Plus**, Upload Database Edition, which allows users to upload and work 
with their own datasets.

HEAT and HEAT Plus are available as online versions and downloadable desktop 
versions. For further information about HEAT and HEAT Plus, please refer to the 
WHO website: https://www.who.int/data/inequality-monitor/assessment_toolkit

### DISCLAIMER 
<hr>

Your use of these materials is subject to the Terms of Use and Software Licence
agreement – see below – and by using these materials you affirm that you have 
read, and will comply with, the terms of those documents.


### TERMS OF USE AND SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
<hr>

Please read these Terms of Use and Software License Agreement (the “Agreement”) 
carefully before installing the Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (the 
“Toolkit”).

By installing and/or using the Toolkit, you (the “Licensee”) enter into an 
agreement with the World Health Organization (“WHO”) and you accept all terms, 
conditions, and requirements of the Agreement.

**1. Components and Types of the Toolkit**

1.1. The Toolkit contains software developed by WHO (the “Software”). WHO has,
or will, make two editions of the Toolkit available:

  (i) HEAT, the built-in database edition, which includes data from the 
Health Inequality Data Repository for use with the Software (the “Data”), 
and which does not allow you to upload your own data into the Software; and 

  (ii) HEAT Plus, the upload database edition which enables you to upload your 
own data into the toolkit, does not include the Data, and does not include any 
reference to WHO, by name, logo, or otherwise.

This Agreement governs your use of whichever edition(s) of the Toolkit you have 
downloaded and/or used through an online platform, including both the Software 
and, if applicable, the Data. References to the “Toolkit” in the remainder of 
this Agreement apply to the built-in and/or upload database editions, as 
applicable in your particular case, including, as applicable the Software and 
the Data.

1.2 HEAT and HEAT Plus are available in two formats: an online version, and 
a downloadable desktop version. The applicability of certain aspects of the 
Terms of Use will depend on whether you are using HEAT and/or HEAT Plus, and 
whether that is through the online or desktop version(s).

**2. Third-party Software**

2.1. Third-party software needed to use the Toolkit. In order to run the stand-
alone packages, you will need the “R” statistical software and a web browser. In 
the stand-alone package of the Toolkit, WHO has provided a portable version of 
“R”, and the portable edition of the web browsers Google Chrome or Chromium. 
These do not require any installation.

2.2. WHO disclaimers for third-party software. WHO makes no warranties 
whatsoever, and specifically disclaims any and all warranties, express or 
implied, that “R”, Chrome, Chromium, Microsoft services, or any other 
third-party software necessary to use the Toolkit are free of defects, virus 
free, able to operate on an uninterrupted basis, merchantable, fit for a 
particular purpose, accurate, non-infringing or appropriate for your technical 
system.

2.3. Third-party software user license(s) and use. To the extent you are 
required to enter into a user license in order to use “R”, Chrome, Chromium, 
Microsoft services, or any other third-party software, WHO is not a party to any 
such license, and WHO therefore disclaims all liability, responsibility, and/or 
involvement with any such license. WHO shall not be held liable or responsible 
for either any breach of any of the terms and conditions of any third-party 
software license, or any damages arising from your use of any third-party 
software.

2.4. No WHO endorsement of third-party software. The use of any third-party 
software (“R”, Chrome, Chromium, Microsoft services, or otherwise) does not 
imply that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a 
similar nature.

**3. License and Terms of Use for the Software**

3.1. Copyright and license. The Software is copyright (©) World Health 
Organization, 2016–2023, and is distributed under the terms of version 3 of the 
GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL v3). As stated in the source code for 
the Software, the Software incorporates or makes reference to other open source 
software, issued under multiple license types, and WHO issues the Software under 
the licenses listed above in part to comply with the those terms. As provided in 
the text of the AGPL v3, components of the Software which are licensed under GPL 
v3 remain governed by that license.

**4. Copyright and Terms of Use for the Data**

4.1. Copyright of Data. The Data in HEAT are from the WHO Health Inequality 
Data Repository. Except where otherwise indicator, the Data is © WHO. Please 
refer to the Indicator Metadata for more information about the source of the Data.

and reserves all rights in the Data.

4.2. Data not part of Software or Published under GPL. Unlike the Software, WHO 
is not publishing the Data in HEAT under the AGPL v3. The Data is not based on 
“R”, is an independent and separate work from the Software, and is not 
distributed as “part of a whole” with the Software, as those terms and concepts 
are used in the terminology of the GNU General Public Licenses.
