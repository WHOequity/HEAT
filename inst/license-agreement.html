<div><span style="font-size:12px;">Please read these Terms of Use and Software License Agreement (the &ldquo;<strong>Agreement</strong>&rdquo;) carefully before installing the Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (the &ldquo;<strong>Toolkit</strong>&rdquo;).</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-size:12px;">By installing and/or using the Toolkit, you (the &ldquo;<strong>Licensee</strong>&rdquo;) enter into an agreement with the World Health Organization (&ldquo;<strong>WHO</strong>&rdquo;) and you accept all terms, conditions, and requirements of the Agreement.&nbsp;</span></div>

<h2><span style="font-size:12px;">1. Components and Types of the Toolkit</span></h2>

<div><span style="font-size:12px;">1.1. The Toolkit contains software developed by WHO (the &ldquo;<strong>Software</strong>&rdquo;). &nbsp;WHO has, or will, make two editions of the Toolkit available:</span></div>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;">a built-in database edition which includes WHO data, originating from the WHO Health Equity Monitor database, for use with the Software (the &ldquo;<strong style="font-size: 12px;">Data</strong>&rdquo;), and which does not allow you to upload your own data into the Software (the &ldquo;<strong style="font-size: 12px;">Closed Toolkit</strong>&rdquo;); and</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:12px;">an upload database edition which enables you to upload your own data into the toolkit, does not include the Data, and does not include any reference to WHO, by name, logo, or otherwise (the &ldquo;<strong style="font-size: 12px;">Open Toolkit</strong>&rdquo;).&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>

<div><span style="font-size:12px;">This Agreement governs your use of whichever edition(s) of the Toolkit you have downloaded and/or used through an online platform, including both the Software and, if applicable, the Data. &nbsp;References to the &ldquo;Toolkit&rdquo; in the remainder of this Agreement apply to the Closed and/or Open editions, as applicable in your particular case, including, as applicable the Software and the Data.&nbsp;</span></div>

<h2><span style="font-size:12px;">2. Third-party Software</span></h2>

<div><span style="font-size:12px;">2.1. <u>Third-party software needed to use the Toolkit</u>.&nbsp; In order to run the Software, you will need the &ldquo;R&rdquo; statistical software and a web browser. In the stand-alone package of the Toolkit, WHO has provided a portable version of &ldquo;R&rdquo;, and the portable edition of the web browser Mozilla Firefox. These do not require any installation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-size:12px;">2.2. <u>WHO disclaimers for third-party software</u>. WHO makes no warranties whatsoever, and specifically disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, that either &ldquo;R&rdquo; or Firefox are free of defects, virus free, able to operate on an uninterrupted basis, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose, accurate, non-infringing or appropriate for your technical system.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-size:12px;">2.3.&nbsp; <u>Third-party software user license(s) and use</u>.&nbsp; To the extent you are required to enter into a user license in order to use &ldquo;R&rdquo; and/or Firefox, WHO is not a party to any such license, and WHO therefore disclaims all liability, responsibility, and/or involvement with any such license. WHO shall not be held liable or responsible for either any breach of any of the terms and conditions of either the &ldquo;R&rdquo; or Firefox user licenses by you, or any damages arising from your use of either &ldquo;R&rdquo; or Firefox.</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-size:12px;">2.4. <u>No WHO endorsement of third-party software</u>.&nbsp; The use of the &ldquo;R&rdquo; and Firefox software does not imply that &ldquo;R&rdquo; or Firefox products are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature.</span></div>

<h2><span style="font-size:12px;">3. License and Terms of Use for the Software</span></h2>

<div><span style="font-size:12px;">3.1. <u>Copyright and license</u>.

WHO disclaims any responsibility or liability with respect to the use or completeness of such license.</span></div>

<h2><span style="font-size:12px;">4. Copyright and Terms of Use for the Data</span></h2>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

The Data is not based on &ldquo;R&rdquo;, is an independent and separate work from the Software, and is not distributed as &ldquo;part of a whole&rdquo; with the Software, as those terms and concepts are used in the GPL.</span></div>
