<p><strong>Acknowledgements (HEAT versions 4.0 (beta) and 4.0 (final))</strong></p>
<p>Ahmad Reza Hosseinpoor (Health Equity Monitoring Lead, Department of Data and Analytics, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland), Anne Schlotheuber (Technical Officer, Department of Data and Analytics, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland) and Katherine Kirkby (Technical Officer, Department of Data and Analytics, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland) conceptualized this version of the toolkit and coordinated its development. The application was developed by ZevRoss Spatial Analysis.</p>
<p>Anne Schlotheuber prepared the supporting documentation for the toolkit, with inputs from Ahmad Reza Hosseinpoor and Katherine Kirkby. Tengfei Li and George Luta (Georgetown University, Washington DC, United States of America) provided technical advice for the calculation of summary measures. The software interface was translated into French by WHO Language Services (World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland), Portuguese by Aluisio Barros and Cauane Blumenberg (International Center for Equity in Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil – WHO Collaborating Center for Health Equity Monitoring) and Spanish by Oscar Mujica (Pan American Health Organization, Washington DC, United States of America).</p>
<p>A number of individuals helped test the software and provided valuable feedback, including Nicole Bergen (University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada), Devaki Nambiar (The George Institute for Global Health, New Delhi, India), Aluisio Barros, Leonardo Ferreira, Inacio Crochemore Silva, and Luis Paulo Vidaletti (International Center for Equity in Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Brazil – WHO Collaborating Center for Health Equity Monitoring), as well as several World Health Organization (WHO) staff members: Molly Biehl, Jorge Castor, Amy Coates, Laurent Constantin, Tarun Dua, Micaela Pereira, Katrin Seeher and Cecilia Vidal Fuertes (WHO, Geneva, Switzerland), Humphrey Karamagi (WHO Regional Office for Africa, Brazzaville, Congo), Henry Doctor, Ruth Mabry and Syed Hussain (WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, Cairo, Egypt), Oscar Mujica (Pan American Health Organization, Washington DC, United States of America), Anjana Bhushan and Mark Landry (WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia, New Delhi, India), Jun Gao, Doris Kirigia and Peter Phori (WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific, Manila, Philippines).</p>
<p>The data presented in this toolkit are based on the WHO Health Equity Monitor database (2020 update). Disaggregated data and national averages were derived from re-analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS) micro-data. The analysis was done by the International Center for Equity in Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Brazil (WHO Collaborating Center for Health Equity Monitoring). Disaggregated child malnutrition indicator data are from the Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates compiled by UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank. In general, standard definitions were adopted, as published in DHS, MICS and RHS documentation. There may be minor differences between the national averages reported here and those reported by other WHO programmes due to small discrepancies in the definition and calculation of some indicators. Please refer to the indicator compendium for detailed information about the criteria used to calculate the indicator numerator and denominator values. Summary measures were calculated based on the disaggregated data.</p> 
<p>Funding for the development of this version of the toolkit was provided, in part, by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.</p>
