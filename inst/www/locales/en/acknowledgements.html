    The Health Inequality Monitoring team (Department of Data and Analytics,
    Division of Data, Analytics and Delivery for Impact, World Health
    Organization, Geneva, Switzerland) conceptualized this version of the
    toolkit and coordinated its development, in particular Ahmad Reza
    Hosseinpoor (Health Equity Monitoring Lead), Daniel A. Antiporta (Technical
    Officer), Katherine Kirkby (Technical Officer) and Anne Schlotheuber
    (Technical Officer). Other members of the team contributed to the testing,
    including: Nicole Bergen (Consultant), Nicole Johns (Consultant), Devaki
    Nambiar (Consultant), Carrie Lyons (Consultant) and Adrien Allorant
    (Consultant). sss

  <p>
    Sam Harper (McGill University, Montreal, Canada) and Patricia Menendez
    (University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia) provided formulas and
    offered technical advice for the calculation of summary measures. Oscar
    Mujica (Pan American Health Organization, Washington DC, United States of
    America) reviewed the software and provided valuable feedback.

  <p>The application was developed by ZevRoss Spatial Analysis.</p>
  <p>
    The data presented in HEAT are based on the WHO Health Inequality Data
    Repository (2023 update). The data from the Determinants component is
    aligned to the WHO Operational Framework for Monitoring Social Determinants
    of Health Equity released in February 2024.

  <p>
    The data presented in HEAT are based on the WHO Health Equity Monitor
    database (2020 update). Disaggregated data and national averages were
    derived from re-analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple
    Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS)
    micro-data. The analysis was done by the International Center for Equity in
    Health, Federal University of Pelotas, Brazil (WHO Collaborating Center for
    Health Equity Monitoring). Disaggregated child malnutrition indicator data
    are from the Joint Child Malnutrition Estimates compiled by UNICEF, WHO and
    the World Bank. In general, standard definitions were adopted, as published
    in DHS, MICS and RHS documentation. There may be minor differences between
    the national averages reported here and those reported by other WHO
    programmes due to small discrepancies in the definition and calculation of
    some indicators. Please refer to the indicator compendium for detailed
    information about the criteria used to calculate the indicator numerator and
    denominator values. Summary measures were calculated based on the
    disaggregated data.
