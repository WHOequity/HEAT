		<p>Please note that the indicator data represents a subset of the WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition. Survey estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g. measurement technical error, recording error etc.,). None of the two sources of errors have been fully taken into account for deriving estimates neither at country nor at regional and global levels. Surveys are carried out in a specific period of the year, usually over a few months. However, this indicator can be affected by seasonality, factors related to food availability (e.g. pre-harvest periods), disease (e.g. rainy season and diarrhea, malaria, etc.), and natural disasters and conflicts. Hence, country-year estimates may not necessarily be comparable over time.</p>

<h3><a id="Inequality dimensions" name="Inequality dimensions"></a>Inequality dimensions</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Health indicators from the WHO Health Equity Monitor database were disaggregated by six dimensions of inequality: economic status, education, place of residence and subnational region, as well as age and sex, where applicable.</p>
<p>Economic status was determined using a wealth index. Country-specific indices were based on owning selected assets and having access to certain services, and constructed using principal component analysis. For wealth quintiles, within each country the index was divided into five equal subgroups that each account for 20% of the population. For wealth deciles, within each country the index was divided into ten equal subgroups that each account for 10% of the population. Note that certain indicators have denominator criteria that do not include all households and/or are more likely to include households from a specific quintile or decile; thus the quintile or decile share of the population for a given indicator may not equal 20% or 10%, respectively.</p>
<p>Education refers to the highest level of schooling attained by the woman (or the mother, in the case of newborn and child health interventions, child malnutrition and child mortality indicators).</p>
<p>For place of residence and subnational region, country-specific criteria were applied.</p>
