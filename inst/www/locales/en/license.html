<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please read these Terms of Use and Software License Agreement (the <strong>"Agreement"</strong>) carefully before installing the Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (the <strong>"Toolkit"</strong>).</p>

<p>By installing and/or using the Toolkit, you (the <strong>"Licensee"</strong>) enter into an agreement with the World Health Organization (<strong>"WHO"</strong>) and you accept all terms, conditions, and requirements of the Agreement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="1. Components and Types of the Toolkit" name="1. Components and Types of the Toolkit"></a>1. Components and Types of the Toolkit</h3>

<p>1.1. The Toolkit contains software developed by WHO (the <strong>"Software"</strong>). WHO has, or will, make two editions of the Toolkit available:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
	<li><strong>HEAT, the built-in database edition</strong> which includes WHO data, originating from the WHO Health Equity Monitor database, for use with the Software (the <strong>"Data"</strong>), and which does not allow you to upload your own data into the Software; and</li>
	<li><strong>HEAT Plus, the upload database edition</strong> which enables you to upload your own data into the toolkit, does not include the Data, and does not include any reference to WHO, by name, logo, or otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<p>This Agreement governs your use of whichever edition(s) of the Toolkit you have downloaded and/or used through an online platform, including both the Software and, if applicable, the Data. References to the "Toolkit" in the remainder of this Agreement apply to the built-in and/or upload database editions, as applicable in your particular case, including, as applicable the Software and the Data.</p>

<p>1.2 Both HEAT and HEAT Plus are available in two formats: an online version, and a downloadable desktop version. The applicability of certain aspects of the Terms of Use will depend on whether you are using HEAT and/or HEAT Plus, and whether that is through the online or desktop version(s).</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h3><a id="2. Third-party Software" name="2. Third-party Software"></a>2. Third-party Software</h3>

<p>2.1. <u>Third-party software needed to use the Toolkit</u>. In order to run the desktop version, you will need the "R" statistical software and a web browser. In the desktop version of the Toolkit, WHO has provided a portable version of "R", and the portable edition of the web browsers Google Chrome or Chromium. These do not require any installation. Furthermore, to use the online version of HEAT Plus, you are required to establish an account with Microsoft, and login with that account, and thereby accept the Microsoft Terms of Use.</p>

<p>2.2. <u>WHO disclaimers for third-party software</u>. WHO makes no warranties whatsoever, and specifically disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, that “R”, Chrome, Chromium, Microsoft services, or any other third-party software necessary to use the Toolkit are free of defects, virus free, able to operate on an uninterrupted basis, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose, accurate, non-infringing or appropriate for your technical system.</p>

<p>2.3. <u>Third-party software user license(s) and use</u>. To the extent you are required to enter into a user license in order to use "R", Chrome, Chromium, Microsoft services, or any other third-party software, WHO is not a party to any such license, and WHO therefore disclaims all liability, responsibility, and/or involvement with any such license. WHO shall not be held liable or responsible for either any breach of any of the terms and conditions of any third-party software license, or any damages arising from your use of any third-party software.</p>

<p>2.4. <u>No WHO endorsement of third-party software</u>. The use of any third-party software ("R", Chrome, Chromium, Microsoft services, or otherwise) does not imply that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature.</p>
