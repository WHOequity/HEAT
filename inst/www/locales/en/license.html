<p>Please read these Terms of Use and Software License Agreement (the <strong>"Agreement"</strong>) carefully before installing the Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (the <strong>"Toolkit"</strong>).</p>

<p>By installing and/or using the Toolkit, you (the <strong>"Licensee"</strong>) enter into an agreement with the World Health Organization (<strong>"WHO"</strong>) and you accept all terms, conditions, and requirements of the Agreement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="1. Components and Types of the Toolkit" name="1. Components and Types of the Toolkit"></a>1. Components and Types of the Toolkit</h3>

<p>1.1. The Toolkit contains software developed by WHO (the <strong>"Software"</strong>). WHO has, or will, make two editions of the Toolkit available:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
	<li><strong>HEAT, the built-in database edition</strong> which includes data from the WHO Health Inequality Data Repository for use with the Software (the <strong>"Data"</strong>), and which does not allow you to upload your own data into the Software; and</li>
	<li><strong>HEAT Plus, the upload database edition</strong> which enables you to upload your own data into the toolkit, does not include the Data, and does not include any reference to WHO, by name, logo, or otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<p>This Agreement governs your use of whichever edition(s) of the Toolkit you have downloaded and/or used through an online platform, including both the Software and, if applicable, the Data. References to the "Toolkit" in the remainder of this Agreement apply to the built-in and/or upload database editions, as applicable in your particular case, including, as applicable the Software and the Data.</p>

<p>1.2. HEAT and HEAT Plus are available in two formats: an online version, and a downloadable desktop version. The applicability of certain aspects of the Terms of Use will depend on whether you are using HEAT and/or HEAT Plus, and whether that is through the online or desktop version(s).</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h3><a id="2. Third-party Software" name="2. Third-party Software"></a>2. Third-party Software</h3>

<p>2.1. <u>Third-party software needed to use the Toolkit</u>. In order to run the desktop version, you will need the "R" statistical software and a web browser. In the desktop version of the Toolkit, WHO has provided a portable version of "R", and the portable edition of the web browsers Google Chrome or Chromium. These do not require any installation.</p>

<p>2.2. <u>WHO disclaimers for third-party software</u>. WHO makes no warranties whatsoever, and specifically disclaims any and all warranties, express or implied, that "R", Chrome, Chromium, Microsoft services, or any other third-party software necessary to use the Toolkit are free of defects, virus free, able to operate on an uninterrupted basis, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose, accurate, non-infringing or appropriate for your technical system.</p>

<p>2.3. <u>Third-party software user license(s) and use</u>. To the extent you are required to enter into a user license in order to use "R", Chrome, Chromium, Microsoft services, or any other third-party software, WHO is not a party to any such license, and WHO therefore disclaims all liability, responsibility, and/or involvement with any such license. WHO shall not be held liable or responsible for either any breach of any of the terms and conditions of any third-party software license, or any damages arising from your use of any third-party software.</p>

<p>2.4. <u>No WHO endorsement of third-party software</u>. The use of any third-party software ("R", Chrome, Chromium, Microsoft services, or otherwise) does not imply that they are endorsed or recommended by WHO in preference to others of a similar nature.</p>

<h3><a id="3. License and Terms of Use for the Software" name="3. License and Terms of Use for the Software"></a>3. License and Terms of Use for the Software</h3>
