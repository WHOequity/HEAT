		<li>Graph facet layouts have been redesigned with css grid and flexbox</li>
		<li>Color palettes have been updated</li>
	</ul>
	<li>New features have been added to allow for greater customization:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Table views have been added for disaggregated data and summary measures under "Compare inequality"</li>
		<li>Graph options now include the option to show/hide data labels, control the size of data labels and choose the number of decimals</li>

		<li>Graphs options for scatterplots showing summary measures under "Compare inequality" now include the option to show data points as setting labels in addition to points or ISO3 labels and control the size of data labels</li>
		<li>Benchmark options under "Compare inequality" now automatically select comparison settings given the chosen country income groups and WHO regions</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Correction to summary measure formulas:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Division of MDBU and MDMU by number of observations (n)</li>
		<li>Multiplication of RCI by 100</li>
