<ul>
	<li>Desktop versions for Windows and Macintosh developed</li>
	<li>Translation of the interface into French, Portuguese and Spanish</li>
	<li>Addition of new maps</li>
	<li>Correction to summary measure formulas:</li>

<p><strong>July 2020 - Version 4.0 (beta)</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Update of the built-in Health Equity Monitor database (2020 update).</li>
	<li>The source code has been completely restructured to improve performance. This included dividing the application into four R packages: heat, heatplus, heatdata, and heatmeasures. These packages handle validating and bundling the built-in database in HEAT and uploaded databases in HEAT Plus, generating interactive charts within the application and static charts for download, and contain all the modules used to build and run HEAT and HEAT Plus.</li>
	<li>The interface has been entirely redesigned to enhance user friendliness:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>The home page now allows users to vertically scroll through information</li>
		<li>Disaggregated data and summary measure views under "Explore inequality" and "Compare inequality" have been separated into two distinct sections</li>
		<li>Graphs showing disaggregated data under "Explore inequality" have been divided into two separate views: horizontal line graphs and vertical bar graphs</li>
		<li>Graphs showing summary measures under "Explore inequality" have been divided into two separate views: line graphs and bar graphs</li>
		<li>In all views, graph/map/table options are now found under a separate tab of the side panel</li>
		<li>In all views, download options are now found under a separate tab of the side panel</li>
		<li>In all views under "Compare inequality", benchmark options are now listed in a separate tab in the side panel</li>
		<li>In horizontal bar graphs showing disaggregated data under "Explore inequality", special summary measure calculations are now listed in a separate tab in the side panel</li>
		<li>Graph facet layouts have been redesigned with css grid and flexbox</li>
		<li>Color palettes have been updated</li>
	</ul>
	<li>New features have been added to allow for greater customization:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Table views have been added for disaggregated data and summary measures under "Compare inequality"</li>
		<li>Graph options now include the option to show/hide data labels, control the size of data labels and choose the number of decimals</li>
		<li>Graph options for horizontal bar graphs showing disaggregated data under "Explore inequality" now include the option to show/hide 95% confidence intervals</li>
		<li>Graphs options for scatterplots showing summary measures under "Compare inequality" now include the option to show data points as setting labels in addition to points or ISO3 labels and control the size of data labels</li>
		<li>Benchmark options under "Compare inequality" now automatically select comparison settings given the chosen country income groups and WHO regions</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Correction to summary measure formulas:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Division of MDBU and MDMU by number of observations (n)</li>
		<li>Multiplication of RCI by 100</li>
		<li>Multiplication of MLD and TI by 1000</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
